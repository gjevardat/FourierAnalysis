# FourierAnalysis

Personal notebooks for learning Fourier analysis and learning python. 
First notebook focus on Fourier series.
Second notebook focus on Discrete Fourier Transforms
fourier.py contains
* Core functions for computing Fourier coefficient and Fourier Series
* Helper functions to compute basic periodic curves (step, triangle, rectangle)
* Plotting utility to visualize results of the fourier harmonics, series and coefficients
